# Cart Page Redesign TODO

## Plan Overview

  - Enhance visual hierarchy (shadows, borders, spacing)
  - Modernize colors (gradients, contrast, accents)
  - Refine layout (grid/flex optimizations)
  - Improve responsiveness (streamline media queries)
  - Add micro-interactions (hover states, transitions)
  - Professional touches (rounded corners, consistent padding)
- [x] Make minor adjustments to Cart.jsx if needed (class names, structure)
- [x] Test responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- [x] Verify functionality (quantity updates, remove items, checkout)
- [ ] Final adjustments based on visual feedback
